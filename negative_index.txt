1> What are negative indexes and why are they used? 
-->In Python, negative indexes are used to access elements from the   end of a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). The index -1 refers to the last element, -2 refers to the second-to-last element, and so on.

-->Negative indexes provide a convenient way to access elements from the end of a sequence without needing to know its length explicitly. This can be particularly useful when working with sequences of variable length, and you want to access elements relative to the end.

Here's a brief summary:

sequence[-1] refers to the last element.
sequence[-2] refers to the second-to-last element.
And so on.
Negative indexes can be used with strings, lists, tuples, and other sequence types in Python.
